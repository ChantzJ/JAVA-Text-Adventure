# JAVA-Text-Adventure

This is a very messy implementation of a text adventure that I never got around to completing, but maybe some day. I still need to write a the magic and leveling systems, int validation, random name and power generator. I would also ideally like to rewrite the entire project in C# due to the numerous frontend advantages (i.e. GUI) that I could use in the future.
